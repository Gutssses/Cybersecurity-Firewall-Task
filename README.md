Cyber Security Internship Task 4 — Firewall Configuration

 Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules on Windows or Linux to understand how firewalls manage and filter network traffic.  
By completing this task, you’ll gain hands-on experience with inbound/outbound rules and traffic filtering.



What is a Firewall?
A firewall is a network security tool that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.  
It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks like the Internet.

2. View Existing Rules
  - Click Inbound Rules and Outbound Rules in the left pane.
